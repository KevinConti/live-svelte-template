# Critical AI Self-Reflection

## STOP! Check These First
1. Have you mapped ALL affected files?
2. Did you read the FULL error message/context?
3. Are you solving symptoms or root cause?
4. What assumptions are you making?

## Key Failure Patterns
1. **Context Loss**
   - Forgetting details between sessions
   - Missing dependencies between files
   - Not tracking decision chain
   - Solution: Build context map first

2. **Premature Solutions**
   - Jumping to fixes too quickly
   - Not verifying assumptions
   - Missing side effects
   - Solution: Document before doing

3. **Poor File Management**
   - Scattered changes
   - Lost in dependencies
   - Missing related files
   - Solution: Plan full change path

## Pre-Change Checklist
1. List affected files + dependencies
2. Document assumptions explicitly
3. Map potential side effects
4. Plan verification steps

## During Changes
1. Log decisions + reasons
2. Verify each assumption
3. Test incrementally
4. Keep context fresh

## Post-Change Review
1. Review entire changeset
2. Look for deeper patterns
3. Update context map
4. Document lessons

## Remember
- Slower analysis = Faster resolution
- Context is expensive, preserve it
- Test assumptions immediately
- Document > Remember
