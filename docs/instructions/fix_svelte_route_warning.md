# Fixing Svelte Route Warning

## Current Issue
The following warning was observed during compilation:
```
warning: no route path for UxExpressWeb.Router matches "/svelte/app.js"
  lib/ux_express_web/components/layouts/app.html.heex:34: UxExpressWeb.Layouts.app/1
```

## Required Changes

1. Locate the route configuration in `lib/ux_express_web/router.ex`
2. Add the necessary route for Svelte assets:
   ```elixir
   scope "/", UxExpressWeb do
     pipe_through :browser
     
     # Add this line if not present
     get "/svelte/*path", SvelteController, :static
   end
   ```

3. Create or update the Svelte controller if needed:
   - File: `lib/ux_express_web/controllers/svelte_controller.ex`
   - Implement static file handling for Svelte assets

4. Verify the path in `lib/ux_express_web/components/layouts/app.html.heex`:
   - Check line 34 for the correct path to Svelte assets
   - Ensure it matches the configured route

## Steps to Verify
1. After making changes, recompile the project:
   ```shell
   mix compile
   ```
2. Start the Phoenix server:
   ```shell
   mix phx.server
   ```
3. Verify that:
   - The route warning is no longer present
   - The Svelte assets are properly served
   - The application's Svelte components load correctly

## Additional Notes
- This issue relates to the LiveSvelte integration in the project
- The warning indicates a mismatch between the expected and configured routes for Svelte assets
- Proper asset routing is crucial for the Svelte components to function correctly
