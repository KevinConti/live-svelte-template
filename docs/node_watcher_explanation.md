# Node Watcher Explanation

## Overview
The Node Watcher is a custom GenServer module that manages the execution of a Node.js process to handle the build script for your project. It uses Elixir's Port system to spawn and communicate with the Node.js process.

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Starting the Phoenix Server
- **Log:** `[info] Running UxExpressWeb.Endpoint with Bandit 1.5.7 at 127.0.0.1:4000 (http)`
- **Explanation:** The Phoenix server is running and accessible at the specified URL.

### 2. Initializing the Node Watcher
- **Log:** `[info] Starting Node.js watcher with:`
- **Details:**
  - `node_path`: Path to the Node.js executable.
  - `build_path`: Path to the build.js script.
  - `cd_path`: Working directory for the Node.js process.

### 3. Node.js Process Output
- **Log:** `[debug] [Node Watcher] [Build] Starting build process...`
- **Explanation:** The Node.js process starts executing the build.js script.

### 4. Client Bundle Build
- **Log:** `[debug] [Node Watcher] [Client] Building client bundle...`
- **Explanation:** Bundling of client-side assets.
- **Completion Log:** `[debug] [Node Watcher] [Client] Build completed: files written to disk`

### 5. Server-Side Rendering Bundle Build
- **Log:** `[debug] [Node Watcher] [Server] Building SSR bundle...`
- **Explanation:** Building of the server-side rendering bundle.
- **Completion Log:** `[debug] [Node Watcher] [Server] Build completed. Output files:`

### 6. Bundle Verification
- **Log:** `[debug] [Node Watcher] [Server] Bundle verified at ../priv/static/assets/server/server.js (22468 bytes)`
- **Explanation:** Verification of the SSR bundle to ensure it was built correctly.

### 7. Watching for Changes
- **Log:** `[debug] [Node Watcher] [Watch] Watching for changes...`
- **Explanation:** The Node Watcher monitors source files for changes, triggering rebuilds as needed.

### 8. Rebuilding
- **Log:** `Rebuilding...`
- **Explanation:** Indicates the build process is triggered again, possibly due to a detected change.
- **Completion Log:** `Done in 433ms.`

## Conclusion
The Node Watcher automates the build process for both client and server assets, ensuring that any changes to the source files are quickly reflected in the application. It provides detailed logging to help monitor the build process and diagnose any issues that may arise.
